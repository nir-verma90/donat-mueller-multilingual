# Zurich 3D the prototype

This is the project description of the prototype for the Zurich 3D project.

## Motivation

In order to visualize simulations in 2D / 3D I searched for tools and I am referring to the Game Engine [Unity3D] (https://unity3d.com/unity), the [CityEngine] (https://www.esri.ch/de / products / cityengine) from Esri and the [GIS browser] (https://maps.zh.ch) of the city of Zurich.

<table style = "width: 100%">

  <Tr>

    <td> <img src = "Schindlerpark.png" width = "350" height = "275"> </ td>

    <td> <img src = "Schindlerpark-GIS.png" width = "350" height = "275"> </ td>

  </ Tr>

</ Table>

## idea

Since cities such as today's Zurich are in the focus of the simulation, it makes sense to build a prototype with the city's 3D data. The city model consists only of the blocks of the buildings with the roofs.

<table style = "width: 100%">

  <Tr>

    <td> <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11026671/47834942-f6822e80-dda1-11e8-980c-832891336d0f.png" height = "375"> </ td>

  </ Tr>

</ Table>

So I would need a technology like [Computer Generated Architecture] (https://cehelp.esri.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.procedural.cityengine.help/html/manual/cga/basics/toc.html ) (CGA) of CityEngine use or develop yourself.

Outside | Courtyard | Architecture | night

<img src = "outside-1.jpg" height = "120" width = "180"> | <img src = "inner-courtyard-1.png" height = "120" width = "180"> | <img src = "architecture.jpg" height = "120" width = "180"> | <img src = "night.jpg" height = "120" width = "180">

* Otherwise it will be difficult to reach the goal within a reasonable time and with the financial means available to me. *

## Vision

Since Unity3D is a game engine, the following project idea was obvious: ** Simulation and Gamification Platform for Zurich in 3D **

Simulation | gamification

Some may now ask: * What does the ** social network ** look for there? *

The ** MRS Mind Research Systems GmbH ** has the purpose: ** Research of thoughts and feelings **

A social network is a memory ** for emotions ** that I want to try to visualize in 3D.

* A ** Like ** is not a differentiated emotional expression?

* What does a Like related to an image refer to?

Answering such and other questions is the purpose of the simulation.

With ** Zurich 3D ** you can also realize interesting game applications ... üòÉ

## Action

To handle such projects it is good to keep relevant literature. Because going wrong is still enough. üëª

* As a procedural model I use [Scrum] (https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/scrum-guide-us.pdf).

* I adhere to [Fundamentals of Game Design] as a game development guide (http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321929679/samplespages/0321929675.pdf).

* As a planning aid, I bought [How to Plan Game Environments and Level Designs] (https://www.worldofleveldesign.com/store/preproductionblueprint.php).

To do everything alone ** is not a good idea **. Freelancers can be found on platforms like [Upwork] (https://www.upwork.com). * Organizing some expertise can not hurt. * üòâ

## inspiration

My biggest inspiration is my ** Mommy **, life in and of itself and of course ** Zurich **. Then come all the instructive and beautiful ** books ** that I was allowed to read. And of course the many ** dear friends ** who patiently listen to my displaced ideas and forgive me again and again when I knock the bottom out again. üôè

## plan / team

The ** plan ** with a ** team ** from me and ** 3 experts ** in ** four weeks to develop the prototype for Zurich 3D **.

 

* ** Donat ** ‚ñ´Ô∏è Life Artist and Computer Scientist ‚ñ´Ô∏è ** Zurich **, Switzerland

* ** Leonard ** ‚ñ´Ô∏è 3D Content Creator, Animator and Effects Artist ‚ñ´Ô∏è ** Douala **, Cameroon

* ** Phil ** GIS, CityEngine Expert / Developer ** Kisumu **, Kenya

* ** Nirmla ** ‚ñ´Ô∏è Expert with wordpress / PHP, HTML / CSS3, SASS, Angular JS ‚ñ´Ô∏è ** Mandi **, India

## Project

The project ** prototype Zurich 3D ** takes ** a four weeks sprint **. Started on Monday ** 22.10.2018 ** and ends on Sunday ** 18.11.18 **.

### üíØ week 1

* Goal: To buy a [3D model of Zurich] (https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/zurich-cityscape-3d-dxf/946177) bought at TurboSquid for over $ 400.-. ** was unfortunately absolutely worthless see video report! **). Alternatively, download the data from the [GIS browser] (https://maps.zh.ch) and try to bring it to life in ** Unity3D **.

* Period: 22.10.2018 - 28.10.18

* Duration: 7 days

* Donat enough hours **

* Leonard 10 hours **

* ü•á Success: 100%

* Summary: The TurboSquid model was a total junk, which luckily I got refunded. ** Leonard ** üë± joined the team and sent a video report on the üí© model of TurboSquid as [Video Report] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJH0NMV72y8).

***

### üíØ week 2

* Goal: Combine data from OpenStreetMap and GIS browser and show it in Unity3D (80% of the time). First demo scene build in Unity3D (20% of the time).

* Period: 29.10.2018 - 04.11.18

* Duration: 7 days

Donat enough hours

* Leonard ** 40 ** hours

* üëç Success: 80%

* Summary: I have not yet been able to organize the city's data as a 3D model in a file / archive. Leonard has sent a video report of his second week as [Video Report] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpmHGtxzrP4). There were still too many open questions about the data and how to generate the facades to clarify why the demo scenes could not be shown.

***

### üíØ week 3

* Objective: Organize the city model Zurich 3D. Check [CityEngine] (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/esri-cityengine/overview) for options and licensing costs at [Esri] (https://www.esri.ch) Switzerland , Find a GIS and CityEngine expert as a freelancer. Contact Zurich artists such as illustrators, 3D animation professionals or film producers. Find employees for 3D modeling, cartoon & anime draftsman as well as draftsman for 2D to 3D model conversion. Visit of a 3D body scanner and plastic figure printing service in Zurich. Create a bookmark collection for all the 3D, Unity animation sources on the internet. Buy and read books about animation, character style, architecture and design.
